\begin{abstract}
We present the density profile of SEGUE-2 spectroscopic halo K giants by considering the selection function information. A sample of $\rm \sim2400$ halo K giants up to $\rm 80~$kpc from the Galactic center and its well-understood selection function enable us to get a robust measurement of the shape and radial profile of the Milky Way's stellar halo out to $\rm 80~$kpc. The data show the stellar halo is oblate and its shape has strong dependence on metallicity (i.e. the more metal-poor stars show rounder density profile.). In addition, we find a strong evidence for variations in flattening with radius. After fitting the data to Einasto profile and a broken power-law with a constant halo flattening, we find the best-fitting Einasto profile with an effective radius at $\rm 21~$kpc, a steepness index of $\rm 2.2$, and a flattening (i.e. ratio of minor axis to major axis) of $\rm 0.78$, and the best-fitting broken power-law with an inner slope of $\rm 2.7$ and an outer slope of $\rm 4.2$, together with a break radius at $\rm 30~$kpc and a flattening of $\rm 0.78$. These two best-fitting models are consistent within 1$-\sigma$. Assuming the halo flattening varies with radii, the best-fitting Einasto profile has a smaller effective radius of $\rm 8~$kpc, but a larger steepness index of $\rm 4.6$, and the flattening changing from $\rm 0.5$ at $\rm 10~$kpc to $\rm 0.95$ at $\rm 80~$kpc. Furthermore, the Einasto profile with variable flattening is consistent with the density profiles with a constant flattening within 1$-\sigma$.

\section{Introduction}
The Milky Way's extended stellar halo contains only a small fraction ($\lesssim 1\%$) of the Galactic stars, but is an important diagnostic of the Milky Way's formation and dark matter distribution. The position-kinematics-abundance substructure in the stellar halo reflects the Galactic formation history, whether halo stars were born \textit{in situ} or are disrupted satellite debris. By now, individual stars are the by far the largest sample of 
kinematic tracers with 
$10~\mathrm{kpc}\gtrsim \rgc\lesssim 100~\mathrm{kpc}$  (as opposed to globular clusters or satellite galaxies), and are hence the best tracers to determine the mass profile of Milky Way's dark matter halo. It is obvious that kinematic tracer samples should have sizeable membership, cover a wide radial range at good individual distances. But the spatial distribution of the tracers, in particular their radial profile, must be well understood to use such tracers in dynamical inferences. This is perhaps most obvious when considering the Jeans (1915) Equation, even in its simplest version, spherical and isotropic:  the tracer
density profile, $\nu (r)$, in particular its logarithmic radial derivative, 
$\partial{\ln \nu}/\partial{\ln r}$, scales the inferred enclosed mass, $M(<r)$, almost linearly.
If we do not know the local power-law exponent to better than, say, $25\%$, we cannot 
infer the mass to better than $25\%$ irrespective of the size and quality of the kinematic sample. To a somewhat lesser extent, the inferred mass also depends on teh flattening of the tracer population. Yet, at present  there is little consensus on the shape and the radial profile of the stellar halo.

The most straightforward way to quantify the stellar halo distribution is star counts. However, this method requires large size and the completeness of the sample, so it is often applied to the photometric catalogs. Very early studies adopted star counts to analyze globular clusters\citep{Harris1976}, RR Lyrae variables\citep{Hawkins1984,Wetterer1996}, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars\citep{Sommer-Larsen1987}, combination of BHBs and RR Lyraes\citep{Sluis1998}, a star sample near the north galactic pole\citep{Soubiran1993}, or K dwarfs\citep{Gould1998}, and found the stellar halo is well fitted by a single power-law ($\nu \approx (distance)^{âˆ’-\alpha}$) with index $\alpha$ of $\rm 3\sim3.5$ and flattening of $\rm 0.5\sim1$. However, \citet{Saha1985} found dozens of RR Lyraes are well described by a broken power-law with $\rm \alpha \sim 3$ out to $25~$kpc, and $\rm \alpha \sim 5$ beyond $\rm 25~$kpc.

All of above studies were based on a few hundred objects at most. Recent years, with the development of sky surveys, the sizes of the photometric samples expand more than $\rm 10$ times. \citet{Robin2000} used a wide set of deep star counts in pencil-beam survey at high and intermediate galactic latitudes to model the density profile and found the best-fit density profile with a flattening of $\rm 0.76$, a power index of $\rm 2.44$. \citet{Siegel2002} found $70,000$ stars in seven Kapteyn selected areas are consistent with a power-law density with index of $\rm 2.75$ and flattening of $\rm 0.6$. \citet{Propris2010} made use of BHB stars from the Two-degree Field Quasar Redshift Survey to find that the halo is almost spherical with a power-law index of $\rm \alpha \sim 2.5$ out to $\rm \sim 100~$kpc. \citet{Sesar2011} used $\rm 27,544$ near-turnoff main-sequence stars out to $\rm \sim 35~$kpc selected from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey to find the flattening of stellar halo is $\rm 0.7$ and the density distribution is consistent to a broken power low with an inner slope of $\rm 2.62$ and an outer slope of $\rm 3.8$ at the break radius of $\rm 28~$kpc, or an equally good Einasto profile\citep{Einasto1989} with steepness index of $\rm 2.2$ and effective radius of $\rm 22.2~$kpc. \citet{Deason2011} analyzed $\sim 20,000$ A-type photometric stars selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 8\citep{Ahn2012} and obtained the best-fitting broken power-law density with an inner slope of $\rm 2.3$, and an outer slope of $\rm 4.6$, with a break radius at $\rm 27~$kpc and a constant flattening of $\rm 0.6$. Straight after that, \citet{Deason2014} found a very steep outer halo profile with slope of $\rm 6$ beyond $50~$kpc, and even steeper slopes of $\rm 6\sim10$ at larger radii. 

In addition, several pieces of work point to variations of the stellar halo flattening with radius. \citet{Preston1991} found the density distribution for RR Lyraes follow a power-law with $\rm \alpha \sim 3.2$, together with a variable flattening changing linearly from $\rm 0.54$ at center to $\rm 1$ at 20kpc. But, other work \citep{Sluis1998, Sesar2011,Deason2011} found no evidence for flattening, but no evidence for a change  with radius.

Position-velocity maps of the stellar halo beyond $\sim 20~$kpc, practically require luminous 
post main-sequence (MS) stars, is turn-off or other MS stars are too faint for large-sample spectroscopy.  RR Lyraes and BHBs have repeatedly been used as tracers to study the halo density profile, because they have precise distances and are bright enough to be observed at radii out to $\rm \sim 100~$kpc (e.g. X08, Deason, etc..). Yet, such stars, most prevalent  in particularly old and metal-poor populations\citep{Bell08, Xue2011} are known to have a different structure and profile from e.g. RGB stars in the outer halo, that are representative of all halo populations. 

K-giants, as tracers common to all relevant halo sub-populations are traces that can both reflect the (mass-weighted) sub-structure, reflecting the formation history, and to probel the halo mass. To this end, it is crucial to construct the halo shape and radial profule in K-giants. \citet{Xue2014} presents a catalog of K giants with unbiased distance estimates, metallicities, velocities and photometric information, drawn from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration\citep[][SEGUE]{Yanny2009b}, which contains $\rm \sim 300$ stars beyond $\rm 50~$kpc. 

For K giants observed in SEGUE-2, one can understand and model their selection function well/ Therefore,  it is possible to determine the halo profile and shape in theses tracers, which is the main goal of the paper here. 
Specifically, we set out to describe radial stellar halo profile from $\rm 10-80~$kpc using parameterized models (i.e. Einasto profile and broken power-law), to explore the shape and its (parameterized) radial variation, and to explore metallicity dependence of the shape and radial profile of the stellar halo.   

In the next section, we lay out the properties and the selection function of the SEGUE K giants. In \S 3, we present the method of fitting a series of parameterized models to SEGUE-2 K giants, explicitly and rigorously considering the selection function. This step is key in obtaining accurate radial profiles. The results for the stellar halo profile and tests on the metallicity dependence of the shape and radial profile are presented in \S 4. Finally, \S 5 discusses the comparison between our results and previous work.

\section{SEGUE-2 K giants and their selection function}
\subsection{Data}
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey\citep[SDSS;][]{York2000} is an imaging and spectroscopic survey covering roughly a quarter of the sky, which has both $ugriz$ imaging \citep{Fukugita1996, Gunn1998, Stoughton2002, Pier2003, Eisenstein2011} and low resolution spectra ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda \sim 2000$). SEGUE is one of
the key projects and has two phases named SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2, which aim to explore the nature of stellar populations from 0.5 kpc to 100 kpc\citep[][and Rockosi et al. in prep.]{Yanny2009b}. The original SEGUE-1 obtained spectra of 240,000 stars with $\rm g=14-20$ to investigate Milky Way structure, and SEGUE-2 spectroscopically observed around 120,000 stars, focusing on the in situ stellar halo of the Galaxy.

\bf{HWR:~} \textit{I would just mention: there are several catergories; here we use exclusively l-color giants, becaus they are the bulk of the sample and they have a good SF}\  K giants are specially targetted in the SEGUE project. There are three sub-categories of K giants named ``l-color K giants'', ``red K giants'', and ``proper-motion K giants''. The l-color K-giant category uses l-color, a photometry metallicity indicator for stars in the color range $0.5 < (g-r)_0 < 0.8$, to select metal-poor K giants, which occupy about 90\% of the K-giant sample. The target selection criteria changed a lot during the implementation of SEGUE-1, so the selection function of SEGUE-1 is fairly complicated. However, SEGUE-2 adopted an invariable color-magnitude cut to select K giants: $15.5<g_0<18.5$, $r_0>15$, $0.7<(u-g)_0<3$, $0.5<(g-r)_0<0.8$, $0.1<(r-i)_0<0.6$, and $l-color>0.09$\footnote{https://www.sdss3.org/dr9/algorithms/segue\_target\_selection.php\#S2\_table.}. Therefore, in this work, we only correct the selection function of SEGUE-2 l-color K giants and use them to fit the halo density profile. To eliminate the contamination from disk component, we cull K giants with $\rm \feh>-1.2$ and $\rm |z|<4~$kpc, which leads to a final sample of $\rm 2413$ l-color K giants. Figure~\ref{f:fkgdistribution} show the sky coverage, the spatial distributions without accounting for the selection function and metallicity distribution along with the distances of the SEGUE-2 l-color K giants after eliminating disk component. The l-color K giants distribute in the pencil-beam on the sky as the nature of the SEGUE survey, and spread out from $\rm 7~$kpc to $\rm 85~$kpc far from the Galactic center. The mean metallicity of the l-color K giants is $\rm -1.75~$dex, and some l-color K giants have metallicities as poor as $\rm -3.5$.

 

\subsection{The selection function of SEGUE-2 l-color K-type stars}

To understand the underlying spatial distribution of the K giants on the basis of the SEGUE sample, we need understand (and account for) the probability of a given luminosity, color and metallicity to end up in the sample, given its direction and distance. 

Spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way are inevitabley  affected by such selection effects \citet{Rix2013}, often referred to as ``selection biases'', which are due to a set of objective and repeatable decisions of what to observe, necessitated by the survey design. Only a small fraction of the sky was covered by SEGUE plates, and for most plates only a fraction of stars that satisfy the photometric selection criteria may be targetted with fibers. Finally, not all stars targetted yield spectra good enough to result in a catalog entry, with a giant classification and a metallicity. Accounting for the pencil-beam nature of SEGUE survey, we will analyze the selection fraction plate by plate (see \S2.2). 
\citet{Bovy2012} and \citet{Rix2013} spelled out how to incorporate this selection function in fitting a parameterized model for the stellar denisty; we follow here their approach.  

 We treat the spectra that have good Mg index and stellar atmospheric parameters determined by the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline\citep[SSPP;][]{Lee2008a,Lee2008b,Lee2011}, but have no strong G band, as successfully observed spectra, because these properties are necessary for giant classification. The spectrum is the sole tool to classify a star as a giant or not, so it is impossible to know which stars are giants in the photometric sample. Fortunately, the sample of SEGUE K-type stars was obtained by uniformly sampling in the extinction-corrected color-magnitude boxes so that the giants to non-giants ratio is consistent from photometric sample to spectroscopic sample. In this way, the selection function of K-type stars reflects directly that of K giants.

In the area of each SEGUE-2 plate, we select all potential targets that satisfy the selection criteria of SEGUE-2 l-color K giants and have good proper motion less than $\rm 11~masyr^{-1}$. To infer the dependence on color and apparent magnitude of the selection function, we look at the distribution of the photometric K-giant candidates in color-magnitude space with the distribution of the successfully spectroscopic sample overlaid for all SEGUE-2 plates together. Figure~\ref{f:flkgbias} shows that the distribution of objects with successful spectroscopic parameters is almost indistinguishable in color and magnitude from that of the photometrically selected l-color K-giant candidates.

Our model for the SEGUE-2 K-giant candidates selection function is independent of colors and magnitudes, but plate-dependent. For each plate we define the number of the ``successful'' spectroscopic K-giant targets as $N_{sp}$, and $N_{ph}$ as the number of photometric K-giant targets. Thus, the plate-dependent selection function (shown as Figure~\ref{f:flkgsf}) is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
S(plate) &=& \frac{N_{sp}}{N_{ph}}   
 \end{eqnarray}

\section{Density profile modeling approach}
Due to the ``selection biases'' of the spectroscopic survey, the observed star counts of the spectroscopic sample can not reflect the underlying stellar distribution. Therefore, to explore the underlying stellar distribution, we must account for 4 effects: (1) the plate-dependent selection fraction of stars with spectra (see Figures~\ref{f:flkgbias} and ~\ref{f:flkgsf} ), (2) the photometric distances that depend on color and $\rm \feh$, (3) the priors of metallicities and luminosities, and (4) the pencil-beam nature of the SEGUE survey, shown as the sky map of l-color K giants in Figure\ref{f:fkgdistribution}. 

Followed \citet{Bovy2012} and \citet{Rix2013}, we express below how to fit the density profile using maximum likelihood method, by taking all of above effects into account. Since we have good $\DM$ for the SEGUE K giants, we use $(\DM,M_r,\feh,l,b)$ as observables. To infer the spatial number density profile of K giants, we assume a density profile with parameters $\rm p_H$ as $\nu_\star(\rm \DM,l,b|p_H)$, and generate the expected observed distribution of stars in the spectroscopic sample by accounting for the selection function, photometry-distance relation and priors of metallicities and luminosities, and then this predicted distribution is compared to the observed distribution of the sample to get the best-fit parameters. The explicit form of the expected rate function is
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm \lambda(M_r,\DM,\feh,l,b|p_H)&=&\rm |J(x,y,z;\DM,l,b)|\times \nu_\star(\DM,l,b|p_H)\times p(M_r)\times p(\feh)  \nonumber\\
&&\rm \times S(l,b) \times S(m(\DM,M_r),c(M_r,\feh))
 \end{eqnarray}
Here $\rm (\DM,l,b)$ are equivalent to Heliocentric polar coordinates corresponding to rectangular coordinates $\rm (X, Y, Z)$. The Jacobian term $\rm |J(x,y,z;\DM,l,b)|$ is to transform from $\rm (X, Y,Z)$ to $\rm (\DM, l, b)$ coordinate. Please note that the volume of each plate is independent on $l$ and $b$, because all the SEGUE plates have the same solid angle of $7~deg^2$. When analysing the data plate by plate, the Jacobian term should be $\rm |J(x,y,z;\DM)|$. $\nu_\star(\rm \DM,l,b|p_H)$ is the underlying spatial number density of l-color K giants (i.e. halo density profile). $\rm p(M_r)$ and $\rm p(\feh)$ are the priors of luminosity and metallicity. $\rm S(l,b)\times S(m,c)$ is the selection function as given in Eq.(1). The explicit form for each term in Eq.(2) is expressed as below:
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm |J(x,y,z;\DM)|_{plate}&=&\frac{d^3\ln10}{5}\times A_p,~~~~~\rm where~~A_p=7~deg^2;~~d=10^{\frac{\DM}{5}-2}~kpc~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}

$$
\rm p(M_r) \propto \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 \rm 10^{0.32M_r}, &\mbox{\rm if $\rm M_{r~min,obs}<M_r<M_{r~max,obs}$} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\
  0, &\mbox{ \rm otherwise}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
\rm p(\feh) \propto \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}\rm p(\feh)_{obs}, &\mbox{ \rm if $\rm [Fe/H]_{min,obs}<\feh<[Fe/H]_{max,obs}$} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\
  0, &\mbox{ \rm otherwise}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
\rm S(l_{plate},b_{plate})=\left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 \rm \frac{\rm N_{spec.}}{\rm N_{phot.}}, &\mbox{ \rm if in plate} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\
  0, &\mbox{\rm otherwise}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
\rm S(m(\DM,M_r),c(M_r,\feh))\propto \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 1, &\mbox{ \rm if $\rm m_{min,obs}<m<m_{max,obs}$ and $\rm c_{min,obs}<c<c_{max,obs}$} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\
  0, &\mbox{ otherwise}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       \end{array} \right.
$$
As discussed in \citet{Bovy2012} the likelihood of the data given $p_H$, can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm \lph &=& \rm c_{\lambda}^{-N_{KG}}\prod \limits_{i=1}^{N_{KG}}\lambda(M_{ri},\DM_i,\feh_i,l_i,b_i|p_H)
\end{eqnarray}
where the normalization $\rm c_\lambda$ is the integral over the volume in $\rm (\DM,l,b,M_r,\feh)$ space. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm c_\lambda&=&\rm \sum \limits_{i=1}^{N_{plate}} \int\int\int \lambda(M_r,\DM,\feh,l_{plate},b_{plate}|p_H)dM_rd \DM d \feh
\end{eqnarray}

Specifically, this normalization integral can be computed efficiently using Gaussian quadrature rule. We adopt 48 transformation points, and then the parameter-independent parts such as Jacobian term, priors of luminosity and metallicity and selection function can be pre-computed on a dense grid. Then we vary (grid or Markov chain) the $p_H$ until we get a good solution. We use the Python package emcee\citep{Foreman2013} to do the model fitting.

\section{Result}
In this section, we present the results of applying the maximum-likelihood method described in \S 3 to the sample of SEGUE-2 l-color K giants. We adopt a set of popular density profiles with constant flattening, such as Einasto profile and broken power-law, and then we test the metallicity dependence of the shape and radial profile and the radial variations in shape.
\subsection{Einasto profile}
The Einasto profile\citep{Einasto1989} is a function that describes how the density distribution of a spherical system changes with distance, which has the same mathematical form as S{\'e}rsic's law\citep{Sersic1963}. Generally speaking, the S{\'e}rsic's law is used to describe the 2D surface brightness (i.e. projected density) profile of galaxies, but Einasto profile is treated as a 3D density profile. The advantage of Einasto profile is to trace a variable fall-off distribution without using a break radius. Einasto profile has been used to describe many types of system, including galaxies\citep{Einasto1989}, dark matter halos\citep{Merritt2006,Graham2006,Navarro2010} and Galactic stellar halo\citep{Sesar2011,Deason2011}. We adopt a similar expression of Einasto profile as the definition in \citet{Merritt2006}, but bring in the flattening $q$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm \nu_{\star}(r_q) &=& \nu_0~exp\left\{-d_n\left[\left(r_q/r_{eff}\right )^{1/n}-1\right ]\right\}
 \end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm r_q &=& \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2/q^2}, \mbox{ which can be calculated from $\left(\DM,l,b \right)$ and q}   \nonumber \\ 
\rm d_n &\approx& 3n-1/3+0.0079/n,  \mbox{ for } n \ge 0.5 \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray*}

The shape of the halo is described by the flattening $q$, and the radial density profile is characterized by the effective radius $\rm r_{eff}$ and steepness index $\rm n$. The smaller $\rm n$ generates a density distribution with steeper outer profile. The term $\rm d_n$ is to make sure the mass within $\rm r_{eff}$ is half of the total mass. The $\rm r_q$ is the spatial radius accounting for the flattening. 

We use the methodology described in \S 3 to fit the parameterized Einasto profile, and get the best-fitting Einasto profile with parameters $\rm q=0.78\pm0.02,~n=2.2\pm0.3,~and ~r_{eff}=21\pm1~kpc$ shown in Figure~\ref{f:feinasto}. To test how accurately our models represent the observed distance distribution of the data, we compare the predicted distance distribution by the best-fit model with the data. Figure~\ref{f:fpdm} shows that the best-fit Einasto profile predicts a comparable distribution of distance moduli with the observation. 

\subsection{Broken power-law profile}
\citet{Saha1985} found different power-law index in and out $\rm 25~$kpc based on dozens of RR Lyraes. Recent studies\citep{Sesar2011,Deason2011,Deason2014} found the stellar halo also can be described well by a broken power-law. The broken power-law profile has been another equally good model to describe the density distribution of the stellar halo. It uses a discontinuous form to describe the variation of density distribution with distance by imposing a break radius. We define the broken power-law profile same as \citet{Deason2011}:
\begin{equation}
\rm \nu_\star\left(r_q \right )= \left\{\begin{matrix} \rm \nu_0~r_q^{-\alpha_{in}}, & \rm r_q\leq r_{break} \\ \rm \nu_0~r_{break}^{\alpha_{out}-\alpha_{in}}~r_q^{-\alpha_{out}},&\rm r_q>r_{break} \end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}
Here $\rm r_q$ is an ellipsoidal distance with the same definition as that in Einasto profile. Figure~\ref{f:fbpl} shows the l-color K giants fit well with a broken power-law with an inner slope of $\rm \alpha_{in}=2.7\pm0.1$ and an outer slope of $\rm \alpha_{out}=4.2\pm0.2$, breaking at $\rm r_{break}=30\pm3~$kpc, together with a flattening of $\rm q=0.78\pm0.02$. The flattening is consistent with that of the best-fit Einasto profile. The broken power-law profile also predicts a consistent $\rm p(\DM)$ to the observation (shown as Figure~\ref{f:fpdm}).

\citet{Deason2014} found the stellar halo drops a lot beyond $\rm 50~$kpc, so we also use our data to fit triple power-laws with six free parameters $\rm \left(\alpha_{inner},~\alpha_{middle},~\alpha_{outer},~r_{break1},~r_{break2},~q\right)$. Here, $\rm \alpha_{inner}$, $\rm \alpha_{middle}$ and $\rm \alpha_{outer}$ are the power indexes within $\rm r_{break1}$, between $\rm r_{break1}$ and $\rm r_{break2}$, and beyond $\rm r_{break2}$ respectively, and $\rm q$ is the flattening. However, we can not find the best-fit of the second break radius, which means no evidence of strong drop beyond $\rm 50~$kpc. We find the best first break radius $\rm r_{break1}$ is at $\rm 30~$kpc, the inner slope $\rm \alpha_{inner}$ is $\rm 2.7$, the middle slope is equal to the outer slope ($\rm \alpha_{middle}~=~ \alpha_{outer}~=~4.2$), and the flattening $\rm q$ is still $\rm 0.78$.
    
\subsection{The metallicity dependence of the stellar halo's shape and radial profile}
The shape of the stellar halo is to describe a halo is oblate ($\rm q<1$) or spherical ($q=1$), so it is characterized by the flattening parameter. The radial profile of the stellar halo is to describe how steep the distribution is and where the slope begins to change, so the parameters $\rm n~ and ~r_{eff}$ of Einasto profile or the power-law index and break radius of broken power-law profile can be used to indicate the radial profile. In this section, we use Einasto profile only to test the metallicity dependence of flattening and radial profile.
 
To discuss the metallicity-dependence of the flattening and radial profile, we split the l-color K giants into three almost equal-size sub-samples according to the metallicities, and fit Einasto profile with fixed $n=2.2$ to them to obtain the best-fit parameters $\rm q ~and ~r_{eff}$. The equal-size samples enable to reach similar precision of model fitting. We find the distribution of less metal-poor stars ($\rm q\sim0.7$) appears flatter than that of more metal-poor stars ($\rm q\sim0.85$), but the three sub-samples have similar effective radii ($\rm r_{eff}\sim20~$kpc), shown as Figure~\ref{f:ffehdependence}. In other words, the shape of the stellar halo has strong metallicity-dependence, but the radial profile has no strong metallicity-dependence.

More metal-poor stars are very old, and likely to stay in distant halo, so we attribute the rounder shape of more metal-poor stars to the increase of the flattening with the distance. In next section, we will look into the variation of the flattening.      

\subsection{The variation of the flattening}
Previous work found the evidence for the increase of flattening with radii\citep{Preston1991}. We also find strong metallicity-dependence on the flattening by fitting to the Einasto profile with a constant flattening as described in \S 4.3, which we attribute to the increase of the flattening with the distances. In order to see if we could find any evidence for the variation of flattening as a function of radii, we substitute the following three expressions for $\rm q(r)$:
\begin{equation}
\rm q\left(r\right)=q_{inf}-\left(q_{inf}-q_0\right)exp\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{r^2+r_0^2}}{r_0}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rm q\left(r\right)=\sqrt{q_0^2+\left(q_{inf}^2+q_0^2\right)\frac{r^2}{r^2+r_0^2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\rm q\left(r\right)=q_0\sqrt{\frac{r^2+r_0^2}{q_0^2r^2+r_0^2}}
\end{equation}
where $\rm q_{inf}$ is the flattening at $\rm r\rightarrow+\infty$, $\rm q_0$ is the flattening at center, and $\rm r_0$ is the scale radius, over which the change of flattening occurs. Equation (7) is our guess on the variation of flattening following an exponential distribution. Equation (8) is a Osipkov-Merritt(-like) flattening[need a reference, but I have not found it]. Equation (9) comes from \citet{Sluis1998}, so we name it as Sluis-Arnold flattening. We fit Einasto models with above three forms of varying flattening to the data and find small scale radii are favored ($\rm r_0 \sim 10~$kpc), with center flattening of about $\rm 0.3$. Figure~\ref{f:fpdm} shows all three best-fitting Einasto models with varying flattening fit well to the observation, and are undistinguishable. The best-fitting Einasto model with an exponential variation of flattening (Eqn. 7) has $\rm q_{inf}=0.9\pm0.04$, $\rm q_0=0.3\pm0.1$, $\rm r_0=8\pm2~$kpc, $\rm n=5.4\pm1.8$ and $\rm r_{eff}=7\pm3~$kpc. The Einasto profile with an Osipkov-Merritt flattening (Eqn. 8) fits well to the data with $\rm q_{inf}=0.96\pm0.05$, $\rm q_0=0.2\pm0.1$, $\rm r_0=15\pm3~$kpc, $\rm n=4.6\pm1.5$ and $\rm r_{eff}=8\pm3~$kpc. When the flattening follows the Sluis-Arnold form (Eqn. 9), the best-fit Einasto profile has $\rm q_0=0.3\pm0.1$, $\rm r_0=6\pm3~$kpc, $\rm n=4.2\pm1.5$ and $\rm r_{eff}=8\pm3~$kpc. The best-fitting models indicate that the stellar halo is very flat at the center, but becomes nearly spherical at larger radii. We compare the three best-fit models of the flattening variation, and find they are consistent with each other (Figure~\ref{f:fqv}). Compared to the stellar halo with no change of shape, the slope of the density profile will vary slower ($\rm n\sim5~ \it{vs.} \rm ~n=2.2$), but the distribution of mass is more concentrated ($\rm r_{eff}\sim8~kpc~ \it{vs.}~ \rm r_{eff}=21~kpc$), when the stellar halo changes from a flattened distribution at smaller radii to an almost spherical distribution at larger radii.

We have fitted a set of models with constant or variable flattening, and Figure~\ref{f:fpdm} shows all models fit well with the data. However, it can not reflect the difference between these models. So, we will explore it in \S 4.5. 
      
\subsection{The model comparisons}
Our best-fitting density distributions can be used to estimate the mass $\rm M(<r)$ within a radius $\rm r$ and the total mass of the Milky Way through Jeans model. According to Jeans equation, $\rm \frac{dln\nu}{dlnr}$\footnote{The $\rm \frac{dln\nu}{dlnr}$ indicates the steepness of the density profile.} plays an important role when calculating $\rm M(<r)$, so we explore the difference between our best-fitted models by comparing their $\rm \frac{dln\nu}{dlnr}$. The stellar halo is oblate, so the density profile is axisymmetric. The spherical $\rm \frac{dln\nu}{dlnr}$ can not reflect the difference caused by the flattening. Therefore, we use $\rm \frac{dln\nu(R,R/\sqrt{2})}{dlnR}$ in the direction along the diagonal line in $\rm (x,y,z)$ coordinate to do the comparison. Comparing all models in one plot will make the figure unreadable, so we compare the Einasto profiles with different forms of flattening variation firstly. The upper panel of Figure~\ref{f:fdensity} shows all three forms of flattening reach consistent density profiles. Since the Einasto profiles with different definitions of flattening variation are consistent, we will only use one of them to compare with the models with constant flattening. Figure~\ref{f:fdensity} (lower panel) shows the consistency between the models with constant or variable flattening.      

\section{Discussion}
We use the dominated part of the SEGUE-2 K giants, ``l-color K giants'', to derive the underlying stellar distribution accounting for the selection function of the data. The ``selection biases'' of SEGUE-2 l-color K giants are explored by the comparison between the distribution of successfully spectroscopic targets and the complete parent set of photometric targets in color-magnitude plane. We find the selection function is independent on color and magnitude, and as simple as a plate-dependent fraction. After that, we apply the plate-dependent selection function to l-color K giants, and the best stellar density profiles are identified by the maximum-likelihood approach.

Based on the data with $\rm 10~kpc<r_{gc}<80~kpc$ and $\rm -3.5<\feh<-1.2$, we find the stellar halo is oblate, and its shape depends strongly on the metallicity. Our best-fitting models suggest a flattening of $\rm q=0.78\pm0.02$, and a steeper profile at larger radii. We prefer to using Einasto profile to represent the stellar halo density as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\rm \nu_{\star}(r_q) &\propto& exp\left\{-6.27\left[\left(r_q/21\right )^{1/2.2}-1\right ]\right\}, \rm with~r_q=\sqrt{R^2+z^2/0.78^2}.
 \end{eqnarray}
Meanwhile, the broken power-law is also an equally good law for the stellar halo density. SEGUE-2 l-color K giants are consistent with a broken power-law with an inner slope of $\rm 2.7$ and an outer slope of $\rm 4.2$, the break radius at $\rm 30$kpc, which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\rm \nu_\star\left(r_q \right )\propto \left\{\begin{matrix} \rm r_q^{-2.7}, & \rm r_q\leq 30~kpc \\ \rm r_q^{-4.2},&\rm r_q>30~kpc \end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}

These two formulae are fundamental results for the stellar density models with a constant flattening in our paper. The results are qualitatively similar to those obtained by \citet{Sesar2011} using photometric main-sequence stars and \citet{Deason2011} using photometric A-type stars, but quantitatively different from them. Furthermore, we find the evidence for the variation of flattening with distance, which confirms the finding of \citet{Preston1991}, but is inconsistent with findings of \citet{Sluis1998, Sesar2011,Deason2011}   

In summary, we find the SEGUE-2 l-color K giants are well described by an oblate density distribution with a constant flattening of $\rm q \sim 0.78$ and a steeper profile at larger radii. In addition, we find the evidence of the variation of flattening. Comparing to previous studies, our findings indicate the stellar halo is not as flat as \citet[;q=0.7]{Sesar2011} and \citet[;q=0.58]{Deason2011}, and the radial distribution of the density profile is consistent with \citet{Sesar2011}, but is not as steep as \citet{Deason2011,Deason2014}. 

Similar to the comparisons in \S 4.5, we plotted $\rm \frac{dln\nu(R,R/\sqrt{2})}{dlnR}$ for the best-fit density profiles of \citet{Deason2011,Deason2014} over our preferred models shown as Figure~\ref{f:fdensitycompare}. \citet{Deason2011,Deason2014} found much steeper density distribution of the stellar halo.

We have applied our best-fit stellar density profiles and the radial velocity dispersion of the SEGUE K giants to the axisymmetric Jeans model to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way by assuming the gravity potential model, and get the total mass of $\rm M_{340}=1.3\pm0.3\times10^{12}M_\sun$ (see B\"{u}denbender et al. 2015 for details).
